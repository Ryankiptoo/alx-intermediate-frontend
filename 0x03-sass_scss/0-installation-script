Steps I took to install SASS:

1. Installed Node Version Manager (NVM) by running:
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

2. Exited the terminal using the command:
   exit

3. Reopened the terminal to activate NVM.

4. Installed Node.js version 20.16 using NVM:
   nvm install 20.16

5. Verified Node installation with:
   node -v

6. Installed SASS globally using npm:
   npm install sass -v 3.7.4

7. Verified SASS installation with:
   sass --version
